  In The Sims</a>, there is no primary objective or goal to achieve, and instead of
fulfilling objectives, the player
is encouraged to make choices and engage fully in an interactive environment.
<br>This has helped the game successfully attract casual gamers.
The only real objective of the game is to organize the Sims' time to help them
reach personal goals and succeed to the best of their ability.
